Description: This package allows for the fitting of spatial capture-recapture
    (SCR) models, primarily to acoustic data. Acoustic surveys are capable of
    collecting auxiliary information in addition to capture histories that is
    informative about the source location of detected cues; examples include signal
    strengths, times of arrival, estimated bearings, and estimated distances. The
    ascr package fits a class of SCR model that allows use of such information.

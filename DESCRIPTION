Description: This package provides functions to fit spatial
    capture-recapture (SCR) models, primarily to acoustic
    data. Acoustic surveys are capable of collecting auxiliary
    information in addition to capture histories that is informative
    about the source location of detected cues; examples include
    signal strengths, times of arrival, estimated bearings, and
    estimated distances. The ascr package fits a class of SCR model
    that allows use of such information.
